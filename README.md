This repository contains projects related to KNN algorithm using Python.

## Introduction: K Nearest Neighbors - Classification
K nearest neighbors is a simple algorithm that stores all available cases and classifies new cases based 
on a similarity measure (e.g., distance functions). KNN has been used in statistical estimation and pattern 
recognition already in the beginning of 1970â€™s as a non-parametric technique.
